    "Multimeters are by far the most useful and most important debugging tool you’ll have while finishing this project (or any electrical engineering project). If you don’t have one at hand, stop reading this right now and order one on Amazon. Seriously. It’s that important.

    "Multimeters can measure a lot of things including continuity, resistance, voltage, current, capacitance etc. But the most useful functionality (in my opinion) is the continuity / diode testing mode. This functionality allows you to check if a diode is working or not (which has directionality), and whether two points in a circuit are electrically connected or not. The multimeter will beep (output of a piezo buzzer) if the two points are connected and will light up the LED if the cathode is connected to GND and anode is connected to PWR. But always remember to turn the knob to continuity / diode testing mode before testing anything! Otherwise the multimeter would be powered off… \n",

    "To provide more perspective, continuity testing is extremely useful in verifying your solder joints either on the printed circuit boards (PCB) or on any other wires. If you’ve soldered something on, probed the two solder points and got a beep, that means the two points are connected. Now this might be good or bad depending on each case. If you meant to connect the two points, then you're all set. If the two points are **NOT** supposed to be connected, then you have a short circuit. This means you’ll have to redo the solder connection, but doing this now will save you a ton of time in the future when you’re running your software on the circuit board and the hardware component is not working as you expected. (Hardware will not work properly if there is a short circuit!). \n",

    "\n",
    "To make our DNAMIC boxes, we need the following major components: PCB / LEDs / IRs/ and solenoids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the multimeter on the PCB is fairly straightforward. If you want to verify connections between two points, you can probe it using the clips. If It’s connected, you should hear a beep. Using the multimeter on LEDs is simple as well. Once you connect them correctly, ***(cathode to GND / anode to PWR)*** the LED will light up (you will not hear any beeps). For IR LEDs, you won’t “see” the IRs light up because human eyes can’t detect infrared light but ***there are [tricks](https://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jhl0204/DNAMIC-Hardware-Documentations/blob/master/Chapter_5.Component_Assembly-Infrared_Detectors/5_Component_Assembly_IR_vF.ipynb) you can use to \"see\" the IRs***. For solenoids, it’s a little different story. If you test out the two leads, although the two leads are not touching each other, the multimeter will give you a beep. How could that be? Is there a short circuit? Did the solenoid valve get broken right out of the package? "

The two leads you see in **Figure 3** are actually two ends of the same wire. The cylindrical coil is hidden inside the component. The exact resistance of the coil will depend on a lot of things, but it will tend to be very low and seem like a short circuit. If they don't have a low resistance, then it's likely that the wire has broken internally, and the valve is dead.
