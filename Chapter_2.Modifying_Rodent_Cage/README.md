### Introduction

The DIY-NAMIC system utilizes a rodent homecage for behavioral testing. In this chapter, the standard rodent cage used in ventilated high-density racked systems is modified for use with the DIY-NAMIC system. Using a Dremel to cut a cross-section of the cage, U-channels are attached on the bottom and the sides of the cage, allowing a laser cut plexiglass wall to be slotted in.

### Rodent Cages

This section will require modification based on the available rodent caging systems.

The plexiglass wall will also need to be modified to fit the relevant homecage[(https://github.com/DIY-NAMICsystem/Hardware_Documentation/tree/master/Ponoko_Final)].

> This **location** was chosen due to the design of the cage hopper and the plexiglass. Positioning the U-channel at this location will minimize the gaps between the metal hopper and the plexiglass **(Figure 4 and Figure 5).**

For the purposes of exposing the cross-section, draw a line at the 5cm mark (see yellow arrow) at an angle **(Figure 2)** on both sides of the cage. These lines will always be posterior relative to the bottom U-channel position and thus will serve as good guidelines for cutting the cage later.

### Cutting the Cage

When cutting the cage, make sure to cut the sides first. Remember that the sharpie mark at the bottom is where the U-channels are going to align, **NOT** where it will be cut. Cutting the sides first will prevent you from making that mistake.

    <b><i>Step 1:</b> Cut the cage according to the numbers shown - Sides (Red) first and then the bottom (Yellow) of the cage. </i>
</p>

<p align="center">

    <b><i>Step 2:</b> Cutting along the sharpie mark along the two sides </i>
</p>

    <b><i>Step 3:</b> All three sides (two sides + one bottom) have been cut and ready to be separated from the main cage body. </i>
</p>

The Dremel rotary tool will produce a lot of fine dust so work in a well-ventilated area. After the initial cut, wash off the fine dust by running the cage under water. After thoroughly drying it, you may also want to use the belt grinder to sand down the sides for a smoother, cleaner finish.

### Attaching the U-Channels

    <b><i>Materials Needed:</b> Loctite Glue (401) / U-channels / Rodent Cage </i>
</p>

</p>

Two U-channels (11.3cm long) will go on the sides and one U-channel (10.3cm long) will go on the bottom.

The U-channels serve as guides for the plexiglassto be slid in. Therefore, all three should be aligned and flat with the surface of the cage. It is easier to align all three of them together if the bottom is attached first. Then, align the side U-channels by using the bottom U-channel as a reference point.

    <b><i>Step 1:</b> Attaching the bottom U-channel first. Apply Loctite glue along the back of the U-channel and align it along the black sharpie mark and hold it down for a few seconds to get a good attachment. Let it cure overnight. </i>

    <b><i>Step 2:</b> Attaching the side U-channels. Align them using the bottom U-channel as a reference point. Use the same steps as in <b> Step 1. </b> </i>
</p>

#### Using Loctite Glue, which allows for normal cage washing and high heat sanitization. 

> After cleaning surfaces with ethanol, apply Loctite glue generously and attach the U-channels to the rodent cage. 401 Loctite is very watery so you will have some time to wiggle the U-channel around if you didnâ€™t get the placement correct the first time. To make sure there is a good adhesion, let the Loctite cure for a few hours, overnight if you have time.

Once the Loctite glue has cured and the U-channels are securely fastened, test out the alignment by sliding in your Plexiglass along the U-channel railings like in **Step 3**. Make sure to try the cage top as well to check for gaps!
