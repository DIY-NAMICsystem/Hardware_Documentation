    "### Soldering or Crimping\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between soldering and crimping is that crimping is an electrical connection done with physical force while soldering involves making a connection by heating up the wires and connecting them with solder alloy. Personally, I prefer crimping when making electrical connections because they offer more flexibility and reliability compared to soldering. However, soldering can be great for making quick electrical connections that you might later “undo” since you can always de-solder them by applying additional heat. Soldering and crimping each offers its advantages and disadvantages but given the components we work with in the lab, I’ve decided to take advantage of both crimping and soldering."

    "\n",
    "When connecting components to the breadboard or generally connecting two points together, we slide in the male wire to the female jumper wire. We can do this thanks to the Dupont connectors at the end. Dupont connectors are standardized pins that are 0.1” (2.54mm) in width. The widths are standardized so that they fit on Arduinos and other breakout boards. In fact, the spacings between each pin on Arduinos is also 0.1” (2.54mm). "

    "Now for prototyping purposes, it is sufficient to just use jumper wires to connect components to the Arduino or to the breadboard. I would do this by sliding in the component lead into one of the female-type Dupont connectors. This wouldn’t work so well when you want to make the wiring permanent. The leads will slide right off with a gentle tug. To prevent this, you would slide in the component lead right into the bare-bone female Dupont pins that have their encasing removed and solder the two parts together **(Figure 5).** In an ideal world, you would directly crimp the components to the wires but since that method proved to be too time consuming, I have opted for this current method."

In stage 2, you can see the jumper wires with their black encasings removed. (yellow arrows) Also in stage 2, you see that the male pins have slid into the female Dupont pins. To make them permanent, I have made a solder connection where the male pin and the female Dupont pin overlap. And finally in step 3, I have shrunken down heat shrink tubes with a lighter. Note that you must slide in the appropriately sized heat shrink tubes before you make the solder connection between the wires and the component. \n",

    "The purpose of the heat shrink tube is to provide the solder joint with flexibility and protection. Soldered connections can be prone to fraying, especially at the juncture where the wire was crimped (red circle). This is because excess solder can potentially seep through and expand the space between the wire and the crimp. Therefore it is imperative that we use heat shrink tubes to provide support to the solder junction. \n"
