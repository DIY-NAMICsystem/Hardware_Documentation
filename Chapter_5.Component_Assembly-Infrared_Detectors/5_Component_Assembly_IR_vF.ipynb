    "\n",
    "IR detectors are composed of two things: IR LED and a photo transistor. The basic working principle is that light and electricity signals are constantly getting converted through a certain medium. Once powered on, the IR LED of the photo interrupter will emit infrared light. The photo transistor, which is located across from the IR LED, will catch that light and convert it back to an electrical signal. "

To do that we will have to consult the [datasheet](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/GP1A57HRJ00F.pdf) for this particular photo interrupter since we don’t want to short the circuit prematurely. Below is an internal connection diagram from the official datasheet. It looks very confusing if you’re new to electronics. It certainly was for me when I started out! Thankfully I was able to find a “translated” version of the diagram (diagram 4). Note that diagram 3 and diagram 4 are top-down views of the photo interrupter. Also note that in diagram 4, the placement of the resistor doesn’t matter – it could as well be connected to ground and it will work just fine (as long as it’s a serial connection). "

This means that we can break the IR in half and still get it to work as a photo interrupter as long as we align the light path of the IR LED to the photo transistor (Essentially the photo transistor needs nothing but infrared signals as input). This will effectively increase the working distance between the two components and allow us to be very flexible. As you might have already guessed, this is what we have exactly done in the lab. \n"

    "IR LEDs are LEDs as well, so we also want to solder on current-limiting resistors to save the LEDs and the board. Just so that we are consistent with the regular LEDs, we will solder on the resistors to the shorter lead. Interestingly for GP1A57HRJ00F IR LED, the shorter lead happens to be the anode (opposite from regular LEDs). Note again that you may connect the resistor to the cathode as well and the current will still be limited. The important part is connecting the anode to PWR and cathode to GND when you are actually wiring the photo interrupters to the Arduino."

    "Luckily camera lenses are more sensitive to light than our eyes are. They can actually “see” (detect) infrared light. This allows us to “see” the infrared light through our camera lens. Test it out yourselves. Take only the IR LED part from the photo interrupter, wire it correctly to the Arduino (anode to GND, cathode to PWR) and power the Arduino with the USB. Turn on your phone camera and shine it over the IR LED. You’ll be able to see a purple glow like in **Figure 8**. This is actually pretty useful and important to us because we want to test the IR LEDs for any defects just like we tested the regular LEDs. If you don't see the purple glow under your phone camera even after powering up the Arduino, that means the IR LED has gone out. \n",
