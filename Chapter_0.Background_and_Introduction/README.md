# Chapter 0. Introduction: DIY Nautiyal Arduino Modular Instrumental Conditioning (DIY-NAMIC) Boxes

### Background - Current Limitations in Behavioral Testing
Operant paradigms in rodents provide rich behavioral data sets allowing for the careful analysis of phenotype in neuroscience and psychiatry research.  However, one major limitation in these studies is the expense and work-load that these studies require.  The equipment for commercial operant boxes can be prohibitively expensive, and the human effort required for these studies is extensive.  Rodents are generally run in paradigms for many months, trained for 1h every day, for 5-7 days per week. The length of time required for task-specific aquisition makes operant behavioral testing especially difficult during developmental periods, such as adolescence. Additionally, appetitive paradigms are generally run under food restriction paradigms, and also in the non-active light phase of the rodent circadian rhythm. We have elimanated these limitations by developing the DIY-NAMIC boxes as a novel tool to measure operant behavior 24h per day in the home cage.


### Advantages of the DIY-NAMIC system

#### 1. Decreased Experiment Time

- Subjects have 24 hour access to a given paradigm, allowing them to perform hundreds of trials per day, allowing faster task-specific learning. 

#### 2. Decreased Daily Experimenter Effort

- 24 hour automated data collection reduces daily experimenter interventions, and potentially stressful daily handling for transfer to novel operant box context.

#### 3. No food restriction

- Subjects have *ad libitum* access to food and can earn unlimited water rewards depending on their task performance. 

#### 4. Compatibility / Flexibility

- Compatible with standard laboratory colony caging setups.

#### 5. Low Cost

- Inexpensive and low-cost relative to commercially available operant boxes.


#### 6. Open Source

- All design files and code are open source - Contribution from members of the research community will improve future generations of this system.
